            <p class="card-title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current. If not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
            <p class="card-desc">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for this free term course and found it incredibly fun I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the least—and most grueling—time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at VR startup."</p>

            <p class="card-title">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="card-desc">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that has transformed my career path. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a mid-level developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
